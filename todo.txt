- Fix and/or remove the violets
- Ensure the Generator.h is more generic (because it is still using some C/C++ code)
- Make "Context" class just a forward-declaration on the output C/C++ code

- Show some kind of line-col error info on parser error
- Do something (or rather, don't do something) when errors happen
- Fix the "out of bounds" error message to be more verbose
- Allow some kind of error-recovery mechanism to prevent full-stop of the parser process
- Maybe add auto {$0} action to each production rule in the grammar

- Fix leak on ReachSet.
